Websites have pages that are protected from regular visitors. If a website visitor can access protected pages they are not meant to see, then the access controls are broken.

Broken access control allows attackers to ***bypass authorization***, allowing them to see sensitive data or perform tasks they aren't supposed to.

#### Insecure Direct Object Reference
IDOR refers to an access control vulnerability where ***you can access resources*** when the ***programmer exposes a Direct Object Reference***, which is just an identifier that refers to specific objects within the server. By object, we could mean a file, a bank account, or anything else.
