If the Id cannot be detected using the above methods, an excellent method of IDOR detection is to ***create two accounts and swap the Id numbers between them***. If you can view the other users' content using their Id number while still being logged in with a different account (or not logged in at all), you've found a valid IDOR vulnerability.
