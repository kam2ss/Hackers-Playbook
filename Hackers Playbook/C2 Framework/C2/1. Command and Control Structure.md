#### C2
The `C2` Server is the main framework used to ***manage compromised systems***. Agents will periodically reach out to the `C2` server and wait for the operator's command.
#### Agents/Payloads
An agent is a program generated by the C2 framework that is ***executed on the victim system to establish calls back*** to a listener on a C2 server.
#### Listener
A listener is an application running on the C2 server that ***waits for a callback/incoming connections*** over a specific port or protocol.
#### Beacons
A beacon is the ***process of a C2 Agent*** calling back to the listener running on a C2 server.

#### Obfuscating Agent Callbacks
**Sleep  Timers**
	An attempt to identify C2 traffic is beaconing and the rate at which a device beacons out to a C2 server.
		The agent beacons out every 5 seconds; this means that it has a sleep timer of 5 seconds.

**Jitter**
	Jitter takes the sleep timer and adds some variation to it; 
		Sample Python3 code for Jitter may look like so:
			```import random
			sleep = 60
			jitter = random.randint(-30,30)
			sleep = sleep + jitter```

#### Payload Types
There are two types of payloads:
- **Staged:** Staged payloads ***require a callback to the C2 server to download additional parts of the C2 agent***. It makes it easier to obfuscate code to ***bypass Anti-Virus*** programs.
	The steps of establishing C2 beaconing with a Stageless payload:
	- The Victim downloads and executes the Dropper
	- The Dropper calls back to the C2 Server for Stage 2
	- The C2 Server sends Stage 2 back to the Victim Workstation
	- Stage 2 is loaded into memory on the Victim Workstation
	- C2 Beaconing begins
	
- **Stageless:** Simplest of two; they ***contain the full C2 agent and will call back to the C2 server and begin beaconing immediately***.
	The steps of establishing C2 beaconing with a Stageless payload:
	- The victim downloads and executes the Dropper
	- The beaconing to the C2 Server begins

#### Modules
In C2 framework, **modules** are like plugins or extensions that enhance the functionality of the system. Each C2 framework has its own way of implementing modules, often using specific scripting or programming languages. Cobalt Strike has `Aggressor Scripts`, which are written in the `Aggressor Scripting Language`.

**Post Exploitation Modules**
Focus on tasks after the initial compromise, such as running tools like `SharpHound` for lateral movement or dumping `lsass` to extract credentials.

**Pivoting Modules**
Enable access to restricted network segments by using compromised systems as proxies (e.g., via SMB Beacons).

***The diagram illustrates multiple victims with an SMB pivot calling back to a C2 server.***

### Domain Fronting
A technique that ***disguises C2 traffic by routing it through trusted services like Cloudflare***. The victim's traffic appears to communicate with a legitimate IP (e.g., Cloudflare), but Cloudflare proxies it to the C2 server based on the Host header, enabling stealthy communication.

---
### C2 Profiles
A technique that uses proxies (e.g., `NGINX`, `Apache Mod_Proxy`, `Malleable C2 Profiles`) to ***control specific elements of incoming HTTP requests***. This allows C2 servers to ***respond differently to compromised devices***. Custom headers (like _X-C2-Server_) are used to trigger C2 responses, while normal users see generic content. C2 profiles help evade detection by making C2 traffic appear as legitimate requests, especially with HTTPS, where headers might be difficult to inspect.
