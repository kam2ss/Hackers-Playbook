#### Command and Control Redirectors
**Redirector**
A redirector is a server (often running Apache or NGINX) that ***redirects HTTP/HTTPS requests based on the HTTP request body***. Commonly used in production as load balancers, Redirectors are used to ***conceal the actual C2 server*** by routing through intermediary servers.

This protects the C2 server from being directly reported and taken down, ensuring collected data remains secure. To further mitigate risks, firewalls should restrict communication to only ***authorized redirectors***.

**Setup Redirector** 
In Apache, we will be leveraging a module called `mod_rewrite` (or the Rewrite module). This module allows us to write rules to forward requests to internal or external hosts on a server based on specific HTTP headers or content. We will need to use several modules to configure our Redirector. The following modules must be enabled:
- rewrite
- proxy
- `proxy_http`
- headers
