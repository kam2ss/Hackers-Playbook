#### Technical Stakeholders
**70-90%** of your report is aimed towards this audience. This is your ***Primary audience*** which includes developers for web app or IT support for networks. ***Report should details vulnerabilities, their root causes, and clear remediation steps.***

#### Security Stakeholders
**10-20%** of your report is aimed towards this audience. They typically request the assessment. They don't fix vulnerabilities directly but coordinate with technical teams. Report should help them prioritize risks, decide what must be remediated before go-live, and what can be accepted.

#### Business Stakeholders
**5-10%** of your report is aimed towards this audience. They usually fund the assessment and focus on business outcomes rather than technical details. Report should highlight the real-world business impact of unresolved vulnerabilities in clear, non-technical language.
