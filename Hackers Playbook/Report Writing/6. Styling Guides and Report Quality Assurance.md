#### Write Clearly
Always aim to avoid ambiguity by using simple and direct language that makes your point obvious. 

#### Professional Writing
- Stick to facts, avoid exaggerations
- Avoid informal writing
- Be consistent - use the same terminology, formatting, and structure

#### General Best Practices
- Write in past tense
- Do not use first-person language - Avoid "I", "we". Write as a neutral observer.
- Mask sensitive information - Never include real passwords or other private data.
