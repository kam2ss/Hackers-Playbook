Appendices are especially useful for security stakeholders and future testers who may need to validate what was done, verify the scope, or follow up after remediation. There is no fixed format, but there are ***two main appendices that you should aim to include in your report***.

#### Assessment Scope
The **assessment scope** documents how closely the assessment matched the original Rules of Engagement. It notes any changes, limitations, or incomplete coverage, helping stakeholders plan next steps. For example, if only 80% was covered, a reassessment may be needed for the remaining 20%, depending on the vulnerabilities found.

#### Assessment Artefacts
The **assessment artefacts** records any changes or artefacts left during testing, noting that full clean-up may not always be possible. Since some artefacts (e.g., webshells) can pose future risks, this sections identifies them and provides removal recommendations. Overall, appendices serve as an audit trail, supporting findings and enabling informed follow-up after the assessment.
