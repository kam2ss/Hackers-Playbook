The largest section of your report will be the vulnerability write-ups. Each write-ups should explain what the vulnerability is, where it was found, how it was discovered, and most importantly, how it should be remediated. This section is primarily written for the stakeholders who are going to fix the issues, such as developers or system information.

#### Structure of the Write-Up
- **Title:** A short, descriptive heading.
- **Risk Rating:** Vulnerabilities should always be rated in ***isolation***, as if all other vulnerabilities did not exist and should use the risk rating matrix such as `CVSS.`
- **Summary:** A brief explanation of the vulnerability and its potential impact in plain language.
- **Background:** Provide additional context to explain the vulnerability and why it matters. This is especially important if the reader is unfamiliar with it. Remember that the developers who will fix the vulnerability are potentially not security experts, so more guidance to help them understand the root cause of the vulnerability will aid them in remediating the issue accurately.
- **Technical Details & Evidence:** Where and how the issue was found. Include requests, responses, payloads, and screenshots or code snippets if needed.
- **Impact:** What an attacker could realistically do with this vulnerability. For example, it is common to say with XSS that the threat actor would steal the user's cookie to perform session hijacking. But what if the application uses tokens instead? Does that now mean that the impact is lower? Make sure to contextualise the impact to the specific system that you are testing.
- **Remediation Advice:** Clear, actionable steps to resolve the issue. It is critical to ensure that your remediation advice will address the root cause of the vulnerability. While you may want to provide additional measures that will aid in further mitigation, ***your first recommendation should address the vulnerability at its core.***
- **References:**  (Optional) Links to relevant vendor documentation or guidance to support the fix.

The most valuable reports are those that ***explain vulnerabilities in the context of the specific system you tested.*** This means your write-up should answer questions such as:
- **Where exactly was this vulnerability found?**  - Be specific by including the endpoint, parameter, or feature where the issue occurred.
- **What assumptions are required for the vulnerability to be exploited?** - Does the attacker need creds? Does it only affect admin users? Is it only exploitable during a certain workflow?
- **How does this affect _this_ client’s environment?** - If it’s a hospital system, could it leak patient data? If it’s an e-commerce site, could it affect transactions?
- **What steps should _this_ client take to fix it?** - Go beyond generic fixes. If you know they’re using a specific tech stack, tailor your advice. If you know that they are using C# with MS SQL, show an example of how to fix SQL Injection specifically in C# for MS SQL database connections.
