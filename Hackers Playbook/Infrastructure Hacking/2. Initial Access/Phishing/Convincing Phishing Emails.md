We have three things to work with regarding phishing emails: 
- `The Sender's Address:` would be from a domain name that spoofs a significant brand, a known contact, or a coworker.
- `The Subject:` Should be quite urgent, worrying or piques the victim's curiosity.
- `The Content:` it would be pertinent to research their standard email templates and branding (style, logo's images, signoffs etc.)

If you've setup a spoof website to harvest data or distribute malware, the links to this should be disguised using the `anchor text` and changing it either to some text which says **Click Here** or changing it to a correct looking link that reflects the business you are spoofing.
	**Example**
	`<a href="http://spoofsite.thm">Click Here</a>`
	`<a href="http://spoofsite.thm">https://onlinebank.thm</a>`
