#### Expired Domains
Buying a ***domain name with some history may lead to better scoring*** of your domain when it comes to spam filters. ***Spam filters do not trust brand new domain names***.

#### Typosquatting
Typosquatting is when a ***registered domain looks very similar to the target domain*** you're trying to impersonate. 
- **Misspelling:** google.com Vs goggle.com
- **Additional Period:** go.ogle.com Vs google.com
- **Switching numbers for letters:** g00gle.com Vs google.com
- **Phrasing:** googles.com Vs google.com
- **Additional Word:** googleresults.com vs google.com

#### TLD Alternatives
A TLD (Top Level Domain) is the `.com, .net, .co.uk, .org, .gov` etc part of a domain name. A common trick would be to ***choose the same name but with a different TLD***.
	**Example:**
		`tryhackme.co.uk` to impersonate `tryhackme.com`

#### IDN Homograph Attack/Script Spoofing
Originally domain names were made up of Latin characters `a-z` and `0-9`. IDN (Internationalized Domain Name) was implemented to support alphabet from other languages such as Arabic, Chinese, etc. However, similar-looking characters from different languages create a security risk, allowing attackers to register deceptive domain name.
	**Example:**
		Unicode character U+0430 (Cyrillic small letter a) looks identical to Unicode character U+0061 (Latin small letter a)
