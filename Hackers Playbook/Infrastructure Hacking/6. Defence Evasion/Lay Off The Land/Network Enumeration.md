Once arriving onto an unknown network, our first goal is to ***identify where we are and what we can get to***. 

**Checking the target machine's TCP and UDP open ports and established connections:**
```
netstat -na
```

**List the ARP table, which contains the IP and the MAC address:**
```
arp -a
```
