The attacker gathers and transfers stolen data to their system.

**Tactics Used:
- Compressing data (using ZIP, RAR, or 7z)
- Encrypting data before exfiltration (AES encryption)
- Sending data via covert channels (DNS tunnelling, FTP, HTTPS)

**Example:**
- The attacker compresses **confidential documents** into a ZIP file and exfiltrates it using **a fake DNS request** to bypass firewalls.
