The Windows operating system divides user accounts into two types: 
- standard user accounts
- administrator accounts

##### The SYSTEM account
The SYSTEM account is a ***service account*** on windows. It runs with the ***highest level of privileges*** on windows. As an internal account, ***SYSTEM doesn't belong to any groups*** or ***have no specific user rights assigned to it***. In addition, the ***SYSTEM account has no credentials*** and is, therefore, ***not an interactive account***. It's primary task to ***handle OS-level tasks and services***.

### Privilege Escalation
Privilege escalation is temporary or permanently gaining privileges from a low-privileged user account on a system. To escalate privileges, adversaries choose between two common escalation methods:
- vertical privilege escalation
- horizontal privilege escalation
