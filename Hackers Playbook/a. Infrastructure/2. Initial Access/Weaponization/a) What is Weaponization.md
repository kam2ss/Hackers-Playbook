Weaponization is the ***second stage of the Cyber Kill Chain*** model. In this stage, the ***attacker generates and develops their own malicious code*** using deliverable payloads such as word documents, pdf, etc. It aims to use the malicious weapon to ***exploit the target machine and gain initial access***.

Most organizations ***block or monitor*** the execution of `.exe` files within their controlled environment. Therefore, red teamers rely on executing payloads using other techniques, such as ***built-in*** windows scripting technologies:
- The Windows Script Host (WSH)
- An HTML Application (HTA)
- Visual Basic Applications (VBA)
- PowerShell (PSH)
