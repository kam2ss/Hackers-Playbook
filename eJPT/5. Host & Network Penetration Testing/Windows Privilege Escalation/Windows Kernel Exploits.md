Privilege escalation is the process of ***exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in systems to elevate privileges*** from one user to another, typically to a user with administrative or root access on a system.

### Windows Kernel
A Kernel is a computer program that is the ***core of an operating system and has complete control over every resource and hardware*** on a system. It ***acts as a translation layer between hardware and software*** and facilitates the communication between these two layers.

***Windows NT  is the kernel*** that comes pre-packaged with all versions of Microsoft windows and operates as a traditional kernel. It consists of two main modes of operation that determine access to system resources and hardware:
- **User Mode**: Programs and services running in user mode have ***limited access to system resources and functionality***. 
- **Kernel Mode**: Kernel mode has ***unrestricted access*** to system resources and functionality with the added functionality of managing devices and system memory.

Privilege escalation on Windows systems will typically follow the following methodology:
- Identify kernel vulnerabilities
- Downloading, compiling, and transferring kernel exploits onto the target system.
