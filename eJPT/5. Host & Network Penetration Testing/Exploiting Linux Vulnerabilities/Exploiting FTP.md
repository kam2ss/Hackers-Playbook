- FTP is a protocol that uses ***TCP port 21*** and is used for ***file sharing*** between a server and clients. 
- Authentication ***requires username and password*** combination. As a result, we can perform a ***brute-force attack***.
- In some cases, FTP servers may be configured to allow ***anonymous access***.
