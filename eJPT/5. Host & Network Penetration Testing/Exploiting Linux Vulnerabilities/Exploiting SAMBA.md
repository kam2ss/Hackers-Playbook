- SMB (Server Message Block) is a network file sharing protocol on a local network (LAN). It ***allows Windows systems to access Linux shares and drives***.
- SAMBA utilizes username and password authentication in order to obtain access to the server or a network share.
- After obtaining legitimate credentials, we can use `SMBmap` in order to ***enumerate SAMBA share drives***, ***list the contents of the shares***, ***download files*** and ***execute commands*** on the target.
- `smbclient`, part of the SAMBA software suite, can also be used to ***download and upload files***, as well as ***retrieve directory information***.
