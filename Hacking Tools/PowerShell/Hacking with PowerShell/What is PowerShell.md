PowerShell is the ***Windows Scripting Language*** and ***shell*** environment built using the ***.NET framework***, which allows direct execution of .NET functions. 

Most ***PowerShell commands***, known as ***cmdlets***, are written in .NET. Unlike other shell environments, PowerShell outputs objects, making it ***object-oriented***. Cmdlets names typically follow a ***Verb-Noun*** format, such as `Get-Command`.
