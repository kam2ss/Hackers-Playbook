### Post-exploitation
Metasploit offers a wide selection of post-exploitation modules that can be used to further analyze a target system. After gaining initial access, an attacker may want to pivot to alternative systems, escalate their privileges, or exfiltrate data from the network. 

Selecting and configuring post-exploitation modules is the same as for any Metasploit module, with one catch. Before you can use these modules, you must first have an active session on the target system – a Meterpreter shell, for example.

### Backgrounding Meterpreter
If you’re currently using Meterpreter, use the `background` command at the prompt to move the Meterpreter shell into the background. This will allow you to interact with Metasploit without losing your active connection to the target system.

Run the `sessions` command to display a list of your active sessions in Metasploit. You can interact with any of these sessions by bypassing the `-i` parameter to the session command, along with the session ID.

### Using post-exploitation modules
Run the `search` command followed by your search term to search the Metasploit database for modules. You can identify a post-exploitation module by its prefix (`post/`). Running the command `search post/` will list all post-exploitation modules in the Metasploit database.

Once you've identified an appropriate module, run the `use` command followed by the module name to select the module. For example, `use post/linux/gather/hashdump` would select the hashdump post-exploitation module for Linux systems.
```
use /multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester
```

### Loot
For some post-exploitation modules, the output is too great to display at the terminal. In these circumstances, Metasploit may save the output of a module to its loot directory. Look for Metasploit information messages detailing where the output has been saved.
