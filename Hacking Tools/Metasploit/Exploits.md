An **exploit** is essentially a series of commands designed to attack (or exploit) a vulnerability found on a target system. 

All Metasploit exploit modules fall into one of two categories: **active** or **passive**.

### Active and passive exploits
If a Metasploit exploit is classed as `active`, the module will simply exploit the vulnerability, run its specific commands, and exit. Typically, an active exploit is launched by the attacker and begins exploiting the vulnerability immediately.

Conversely, a `passive` exploit is launched and then waits for a connection with the target system. Only once an incoming connection is created will the passive exploit perform its attack. For this reason, passive exploits often focus on client-based connections, such as web browsers or FTP clients, whereas an active exploit can target any vulnerable system.

### Using exploits
As with all Metasploit modules, you can search for appropriate exploit modules by using the search command. For example, running the command search `exploit/windows/smb` will show you all modules suitable for exploiting a Server Message Block (SMB) service on Windows.

You can also make more generic searches in the Metasploit database using keywords. The `search Tomcat RCE` command, for instance, will search for all modules that include that string in either the name or description of the module.

### Configuring exploits
Once you've loaded the module, you’ll need to adjust the configuration options before you can launch the exploit. To list all options available to your current module, run the `show options` command. Together, your commands will look like the following, using PSExec as the vulnerable exploit:
```plaintext
msf> use exploit/windows/smb/psexec
exploit(psexec) > show options
```

Options with predefined values can be found under the **Current Setting** heading, while those that need values are labeled under the **Required** heading.

### Targets
While some Metasploit exploits are specific to an operating system, others are compatible with a wider range of targets. If an exploit starts with the prefix `multi/`, you’ll likely find that it has multiple targets available for use. In these circumstances, you can run the `show targets` command to list all available targets.

However, even modules designed for specific operating systems may have multiple targets available. For instance, running the `show targets` command on the `windows/smb/psexec` will also provide a list of targets, but rather than operating systems, you'll be provided with potential methods for the exploit to run on the Windows host.

You can set the exploit target in the same way as any other module option, using `target` as the option name. For example, from the options above, the command `set target 2` would change the target to `Native upload`.
