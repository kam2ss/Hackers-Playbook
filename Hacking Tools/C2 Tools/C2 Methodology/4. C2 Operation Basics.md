#### Basic Operational Security
You should never have your C2 management interface directly accessible.

#### Accessing your Remote C2 Server that's Listening Locally
SSH port-forwarding allows secure access to C2 server. It either allows us to host resources on a remote machine by forwarding a local port to the remote server, or allows us to access local resources on the remote machine we are connecting to.

**Example:**
Teamserver is listening on localhost on TCP/55553. In order to 
```
ssh -L 55553:127.0.0.1:55553 root@IP
```

#### Listener Type
**Standard**
Communicate directly over a raw TCP or UDP socket, sending commands in cleartext. 

**HTTP/HTTPS Listeners**
Uses techniques like Domain Fronting[[1. Command and Control Structure#Domain Fronting|Note]] or Malleable C2 profiles to mask a C2 server. Traffic is less likely to be blocked by NGFW, when used HTTPS.

**DNS Listener**
Used in data exfiltration stage.

**SMB Listener**
Used when dealing with a restricted network. Often enables more flexible pivoting with multiple devices talking to each other.
