The `sed` command is commonly used to search and replace specific string patterns from text. Unlike `tr`, `sed` can search and replace for more specific strings rather than simply converting all instances of a character in the text.

A typical `sed` command is constructed like this:
`sed ‘s/pattern_to_find/pattern_to_replace/g’ filewitherror.txt`

Broken down, this command:
- Opens the file called ‘filewitherror.txt’
- Looks for the string 'pattern_to_find' in the text file. If it finds any;
- Replaces the string ‘pattern_to_find’ with the string “pattern_to_replace”
- Prints the results to the string

If, for example, you wanted to capitalize all instances of a name (e.g., Alice) in a file, `sed` would be advantageous over `tr`. `tr` could replace all lowercase `a` characters with their uppercase equivalent, but this would also convert characters you don’t want to convert. The command `sed s/alice/Alice/g file.txt > newfile.txt` would instead be used.
