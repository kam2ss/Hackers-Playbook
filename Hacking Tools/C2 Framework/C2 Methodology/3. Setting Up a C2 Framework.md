#### Armitage
**Downloading, Building, and Installing Armitage**
```
git clone https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/packages/armitage.git && cd armitage
```

```
bash package.sh
```

```
cd ./release/unix/ && ls -al
```

**Teamserver**
This is the file that will start the Armitage server that multiple users will be able to connect to.

**Preparing our Environment**
Armitage relies heavily on Metasploit's Database functionality. So, before launching Armitage, we must do:
- **Start and initialize the database before launching Armitage**:
	```
	systemctl start postgresql && systemctl status postgresql
	```

- **Initialize the Database so that Metasploit can use it**. (cannot be root)
	```
	msfdb --use-defaults delete
	msfdb --use-defaults init
	```

- **Starting and connecting to Armitage**
	```
	cd /opt/armitage/release/unix && ./teamserver YourIP PASSWORD
	```

- **Starting Armitage**
	```
	cd /opt/armitage/release/unix && ./armitage
	```
